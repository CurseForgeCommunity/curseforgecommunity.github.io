# Community Tools

## CF-MC-Server

This one packs a punch. It's a CLI (Command Line Interface) that allows you to install a Minecraft server, with the extra feature, that you can download modpacks from CurseForge with it, and use as servers.

## What CurseForge project is this? / CFLookup

This project aims to provide a way to look up CurseForge projects by their ID, and get the project's data, which is used to get the project's page.

And we also get really cool embeds, that you can use in your Discord server, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
